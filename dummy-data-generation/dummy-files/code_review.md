# Code Review: Project "Please Work This Time"
Reviewer: Senior Dev (aged by 10 years this sprint)
Date: Today
Coffee Level: Dangerously Low

## Overview
Code quality has reached new levels of creative chaos. It's like modern art, but it compiles.

## Critical Issues (a.k.a. "Why is it on fire?")
1. **Line 42**: Found a TODO comment from 2019 that just says "fix this later"
2. **Function naming**: `doTheThing()` is not descriptive enough
3. **Error handling**: `// It works on my machine` is not proper error handling
4. **Comments**: Half are in ancient Latin, other half are ASCII art

## Security Concerns
- Password is currently "password123" (improvement from "password")
- SQL injection vulnerability could be exploited by a determined toddler
- User permissions: everyone is admin (democracy!)

## Performance Issues
- Algorithm complexity: O(dear god why)
- Memory leaks faster than a government whistleblower
- Loading time: perfect for meditation sessions

## Positive Notes
- Code is very creative and shows artistic expression
- Commenting style is unique (interpretive dance in text form)
- Bug count is impressively high (we're overachievers)

## Recommendations
1. Sacrifice to the coding gods
2. Burn it down and start over
3. Consider career in gardening
4. Update resume
5. Invest in stress balls
